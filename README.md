Build an alarm clock. As this is an open-ended exercise, the look of the clock and implementation of its functionalities are left to you. At a minimum your clock should have:
○ time
○ ability to set alarm
○ an indication that alarm has gone off

Please write vanilla javascript. Do not use any frameworks or component library.
